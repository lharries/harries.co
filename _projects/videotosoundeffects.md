For the launch of the ElevenLabs Sound Effects API, [Austin Malerba](https://x.com/austin_malerba) and I built [VideoToSoundEffects.com](https://www.videotosoundeffects.com/). It allows you to upload any video and generate a sound effect for it. We built it using ElevenLabs, OpenAI's GPT-4o, and WASM.

We cranked it out in 1 day. The launch video was seen by 100k+ people, 25k+ people visited the site, and it was feature in [Tom's guide](https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/i-put-elevenlabs-new-ai-sound-effects-generator-to-the-test-its-great-for-ai-video).

You can see the [demo video here](https://x.com/elevenlabsio/status/1802805510510424222) and the [code here](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-examples/tree/main/examples/sound-effects/video-to-sfx).
