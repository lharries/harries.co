MazeExplorer is a customisable 3D benchmark for assessing generalisation in Reinforcement Learning. It is based on the 3D first-person game Doom and the open-source environment VizDoom. I co-led the development while at Microsoft Research.

We presented MazeExplorer as a poster presentation at NeurIPS 2023 and it was published in the IEEE Conference on Games. The code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/maze-explorer).
