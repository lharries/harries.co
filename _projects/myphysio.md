We developed a tool to gamify physiotherapy workouts by using machine learning to classify poses. The aim is to increase adherence of at home workouts. All training and prediction is done in-browser using Tensorflow.js, reducing any reliance on servers and meaning your images never leave the computer - maintaining privacy. Winner of HackCambridge 2019.
