A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to connect LLMs to your personal WhatsApp account.

You can send and read your personal Whatsapp messages (including images, videos, documents, and audio messages), search your contacts and send messages.

I built it in a weekend and it went surprisingly viral. It's now one of the most used MCP servers and has 3k+ stars on GitHub. Code and instructions are from [here](https://github.com/lharries/whatsapp-mcp).
