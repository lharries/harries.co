We built a reinforcement learning system for testing software, specifically the Windows operating system. It combined Graph Neural Networks with Reinforcement Learning to trigger desired software functionality for testing. I co-led the development while at Microsoft Research. The paper was accepted as a workshop paper at ICML 2019 and is [available here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08220).
