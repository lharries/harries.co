We created a proof of concept for faster and cheaper screening of Macular Degeneration. It is built for Google Cardboard which turns any phone into a VR headset.

The solution has two parts: mapping the functional visual field; and simulating what it's like living with MD by warping a real-time camera feed. Winner of Allia's Serious Impact Hackathon 2017. The code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/sudo-challenge-mapmd/mapper).
