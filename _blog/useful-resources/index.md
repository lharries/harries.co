A collection of tools, guides, and courses that I found useful or wish I had found earlier! The topics include Computer Science, Machine Learning, Machine Learning applied to Medicine, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning.

## General

- [HackerNews Search](https://medium.com/@lharries/the-hidden-power-of-hacker-news-search-d0f03845d0b5) [Search Engine] Incredibly useful for finding new resources

- [Awesome list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) [List of Resources] Curated list of awesome lists

## New to programming?

- [Harvard CS50](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) [MOOC] If you want to learn how to build stuff (think apps, websites, startups. etc.) then use this to start your journey.

- [Learn Python for DataScience](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science) [MOOC] If you want to learn Data Science (think research projects, extra job skills, etc.) then use this to start your journey.

## New to machine learning?

If you don’t yet know how to program I’d definitely start with the courses mentioned above. Then choose one of the following:

- [Fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai/) Deep Learning [MOOC] “_Learn how to build state of the art models without needing graduate-level math — but also without dumbing anything down_”. I would highly recommend this course, although they suggest having at least one year of python beforehand.

- [Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) [MOOC] Arguably the most popular machine learning course online. It with the fundamentals, as opposed to the top-down approach of Fast.ai.

## Programming

## Python

- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) [Interactive tutorials] Start here
